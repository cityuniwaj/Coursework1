              <br>
              Minecraft is a game that i have been playing for over 10 years now. it is a game
              for all ages and is still being updated to this day. Usually when i play minecraft 
              it will always be with a few friends and we would be playing on survival mode but 
              every now and then i go into creative mode and build random structures like the 
              ones you see in the pictures.
